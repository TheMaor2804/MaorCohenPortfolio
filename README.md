## Getting Started

Static Portfolio Pages:
To view the static portfolio pages, simply open the index.html file in your web browser.

JavaScript Projects:
To run the JavaScript projects, you'll need a local development environment with a live server. This is because these projects utilize features like API requests and import statements, which require a server to function correctly.

Recommended Setup:

    Live Server Extension: Install the Live Server extension in your code editor (Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc.) for easy local development.
    Node.js and npm (or yarn): Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/. This will also install npm (or use yarn for package management).

Once set up, open the project folder in your code editor, right-click on the index.html file, and select "Open with Live Server" to start the development server.
